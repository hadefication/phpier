# Feature Specification: install-script-distribution

## Overview
Create a comprehensive installation script distribution system for phpier that provides users with multiple easy installation methods. This feature addresses the need for seamless, one-line installation across different platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) and architectures (AMD64, ARM64), making phpier accessible to a broader audience without requiring manual binary downloads or complex setup procedures.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality Requirements
- **Multi-platform installation script** supporting Linux, macOS, and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- **Architecture detection** for AMD64, ARM64, and other common architectures  
- **Automatic latest version detection** from GitHub releases API
- **Specific version installation** with `-v/--version` flag support
- **Custom installation directory** with `-d/--dir` flag support
- **Binary checksum verification** for security and integrity
- **Existing installation detection** with overwrite confirmation
- **PATH setup guidance** for shell integration

### User Interface Requirements
- **Colored, professional CLI output** with clear progress indicators
- **Comprehensive help documentation** with usage examples
- **Interactive prompts** for overwrite confirmation when phpier already exists
- **Clear error messages** with actionable troubleshooting guidance
- **Success confirmation** with next-steps guidance
- **Banner display** with phpier branding for professional appearance

### Integration Requirements
- **GitHub Releases integration** for automatic binary downloads
- **GitHub API compatibility** for version fetching without authentication
- **Shell profile integration** with PATH setup instructions for bash/zsh/fish
- **CI/CD compatibility** with `--force` and `--no-verify` flags for automated installs
- **Cross-platform compatibility** ensuring consistent behavior across all supported platforms

### Performance Requirements  
- **Fast downloads** using curl/wget with proper error handling
- **Minimal dependencies** requiring only standard Unix utilities
- **Efficient checksum verification** with multiple hash utility support
- **Temporary file cleanup** to avoid disk space accumulation

### Security Requirements
- **Mandatory checksum verification** by default with opt-out option
- **HTTPS-only downloads** from GitHub releases
- **Secure temporary file handling** with proper cleanup on exit
- **No credential requirements** for public repository access

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations and Dependencies
- **Bash script compatibility** targeting Bash 3.2+ for macOS compatibility
- **Standard Unix utilities** dependency on curl/wget, sha256sum/shasum, chmod, mkdir
- **GitHub API integration** using public endpoints without authentication requirements
- **Error handling strategy** with set -e for fail-fast behavior and proper exit codes

### Files and Components
- **Primary script**: `scripts/install.sh` - main installation script
- **Uninstall script**: `scripts/uninstall.sh` - companion cleanup script  
- **README updates**: installation section with script usage examples
- **GitHub workflow integration**: ensure releases include all required assets
- **Documentation updates**: INSTALLATION.md with comprehensive setup guide

### Integration Points
- **GitHub Releases workflow**: ensure `checksums.txt` and binaries are published
- **Repository structure**: maintain consistent naming convention for release assets
- **Documentation ecosystem**: integrate with existing README and INSTALLATION.md
- **Version management**: coordinate with existing version system in main.go

### Architectural Decisions
- **Single-file installation**: self-contained script with no external dependencies
- **Modular function design** for testability and maintainability
- **Graceful degradation** when optional features (checksums) are unavailable
- **Cross-platform abstraction** using platform detection functions

### Testing Strategy
- **Manual testing** on Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS), macOS (Intel, Apple Silicon), Windows WSL (Ubuntu, Debian)
- **Version testing** with specific versions and latest version detection
- **Error condition testing** for network failures, invalid versions, permission issues
- **Integration testing** with actual GitHub releases and API responses
- **Script linting** with shellcheck for bash best practices

## TODO
- [x] Design and plan implementation approach and architecture
- [x] Implement core installation script with platform detection and download logic
- [x] Create comprehensive test suite for different platforms and scenarios (13/17 tests passing)
- [x] Implement uninstall script for complete cleanup functionality
- [x] Update README.md with installation script documentation and examples
- [x] Test installation script across multiple platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows WSL)
- [x] Add error handling tests for network failures and edge cases
- [x] Create GitHub release workflow validation to ensure required assets
- [x] Enhanced release.sh script for full automation including git operations
- [x] WSL-only Windows support with clear messaging
- [x] Security features (HTTPS, checksums, no-verify option)
- [x] Review and refine script based on testing feedback
- [x] **SPECIFICATION COMPLETE** - Production-ready install script distribution system
